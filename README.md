# World-Marriage-Dataset-Analysis
The World Marriage Dataset offers an extensive collection of data on the marital status of the population by age and sex across 232 countries or regions from 1970 to 2019. The dataset consists of 271,605 rows and 9 columns, providing a snapshot of the marital status (Divorced, Married, Single) for different age groups of men and women. Each row in the dataset represents a particular age group of men, with marital status and other associated information.

The objective of this project is to conduct an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and insights regarding marital status trends across countries, genders, and age groups.
